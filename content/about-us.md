Freedom Security Solutions is a cloud based security brokerage specializing in first class security solutions for all industries.  After 3 years in the private security sector we saw a void in the security industry and wanted to capitalize with our innovative technology solutions. Our in-house workflow and communication platforms are designed to expedite and seamlessly appoint a qualified vendor to the designated post meanwhile creating an overall satisfying experience for the client. 

Freedom’s success stems from our large network of over 2,500 private security vendors nationwide that are skilled and trained in all industries. This is what makes Freedom your one stop shop.  Our database along with our extensive vendor vetting process allows us to handpick from previously vetted, compliant and licensed vendors anywhere in the United States. 

Freedom’s services consist of all tiers of hourly armed and unarmed security officers with many variations of skill sets and certifications.  Executive protection, Fire watch, and emergency coverage are also additional services Freedom provides.  We understand that security for your assets or properties are not cookie cutter which is why all job posts are tailored around the client’s needs and budget.  
 
Freedom’s vision is to change the whole perception of the security industry with our double oversight and management processes.  We want our clients to see that they are not just another number.  We accomplish this by providing one on one customer service before, during and after the job. Providing superior service, building relationships and earning our clients trust is most important.
